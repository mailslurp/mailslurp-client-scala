   * PageEmailProjection
   * Paginated email projection results. EmailProjections and EmailPreviews are essentially the same but have legacy naming issues. Page index starts at zero. Projection results may omit larger entity fields. For fetching a full email entity use the projection ID with individual method calls. For emails there are several methods for fetching message bodies and attachments.
